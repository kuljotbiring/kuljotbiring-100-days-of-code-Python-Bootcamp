"""
You are going to write a program that will mark a spot with an X.

In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.

This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what the nested list looks like:

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

In the starting code, we have used new lines (\n) to format the three rows into a square, like this:

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

This is to try and simulate the coordinates on a real map.
