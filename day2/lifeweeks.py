Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live
until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

    You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.
