"""
Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.

You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.

IMPORTANT: The result should be a list that contains Integers, not Strings. Try to use List Comprehension instead of a
Loop.
